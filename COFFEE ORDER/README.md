# Coffee order
 I've developed an app as coffee order machine.
 In this, user will get to order any number of coffee cups of his/her choice.
 Coffee count can be increased or decreased using + and - button.
 " + " and " - " button updates the increment/decrement function in back-end. 
 After the number is decided , user can press on order to see the price he\she has to pay.
 Price i.e calculated & Thank You message will be printed.
